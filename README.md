# Sumologic-DatePickerHelper
A powershell scritped gui to generate date time strings to paste into the sumologic search time box on search.

It can be tricky putting abosolute start/end times into the sumologic search time box. This is a script you can run so you can use gui date pickers to generate the start/end time strings.

It generates both dd/mm and mm/dd formats so you can use it with each type of browser time zone setting.
